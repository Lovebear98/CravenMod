      "Unbidden, that gnawing @#rneed@ claws up inside your gut again, demanding outlet. Demanding ~#rsacrifice.~ Your stomach churns in @#rdisgust@ at yourself, even as the ~#rsweet~ taste of ~#rflesh~ and ~#rviscera~ invades your mind. NL Are you really this pathetic?",
      "You are. NL You #rare. NL You are a pathetic little craven ~#rexcuse~ for a man driven by your addiction, no better than a wild ~#ranimal~ chasing a thrill. And here, @#rnobody@ can condemn you for it.",
      "Pathetic you may be, but you're here because you worked up the #ycourage to change. Everything you've done is @#runforgivable.@ There is @rno redemption. But there is renewal, and if it takes using these twisted impulses to find it you'll keep using them.",
      "You are, and you don't want to be this hunger's @#rslave@ anymore. You can't bring back the dead, and you can't undo your crimes. You've selfishly ~#rstolen~ so many lives that you no longer deserve yours, but you can't make all those deaths @#rworthless@ by giving up here."
